Figure 5: Enrichment of CTCF binding features within inferred boundaries. (A) Outline of the strategy to infer the width of individual boundaries using the relative IS”. Individual boundaries extend from the center bin up to the first bin on either side that has a value below a cut-off that is defined as the average relative IS” value (IS”) within the 250 kb up- and downstream of all boundaries that were included in this study (dashed line). Coloured lines represent the average IS” signal (10 kb bins) for each category of boundaries, with shaded areas indicating the 10%-90% interval of the signal. (B) Histogram with the distribution of inferred width for individual boundaries in the three previously identified categories. (C) Visualization strategy for the spacing of CTCF features within and around extended boundaries. For all boundaries, signal in the two bins at the extremities (grey bins) and 5 first bins in the left and right TAD are determined. For boundaries that span 3 or more bins, the internal bins are proportionally divided over 2 (narrow boundaries) or 8 bins (intermediate and extended boundaries). For all resulting bins, the signal is normalized to the number of boundaries for each category, or to the boundaries that span 3 or more bins (for signal within the boundary). (D) Average number of CTCF peaks per bin within and around the inferred boundaries. (E) Average CTCF peak signal per bin within and around the inferred boundaries. (F) Average CTCF motif orientation bias per bin within and around the inferred boundaries. Bias is determined by substracting the average number of motifs in a positive orientation from the number of motifs in a negative orientation.
