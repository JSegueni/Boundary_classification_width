Figure S5: Developmental dynamics of boundary width. (A) Pile-ups and heatmaps of the normalized insulation score IS and its normalized second derivative (IS‚Äù) in mouse mESCs, mouse Neural Progenitor Cells (mNPCs) and mouse Cortical Neurons (mCNs) around the TAD boundaries previously identified in mESCs. Average signal for the three categories in a window of 100 kb up- and downstream of the boundaries is indicated on top and heatmaps for individual boundaries are depicted below. (B) Examples of TAD boundaries with changes in insulation width between mESCs and mCNs, associated with reorganization of CTCF binding. Hi-C data is depicted above. Purple arrowheads indicate the position of the boundary in mESCs. Below, tracks for the Hi-C insulation score, CTCF peaks and computationally inferred width of the boundaries (purple boxes; see below) are shown. The arrow in the gene track for the right example indicates the Zfp42 gene, a pluripotency marker (also known as REX-1 in the human genome, whose activity is restricted to embryonic stem cells.
