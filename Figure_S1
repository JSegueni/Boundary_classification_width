Figure S1: Principal component analysis of TAD boundaries with different widths. Visualization of the first and second principal component of the second derivative of the Insulation score IS‚Äù for the three boundary clusters as described in Fig. 2, which together make up nearly 68% of the variance. Although the contribution of the additional principal components is taken along in the k-means clustering approach as well, the three clusters already show a nearly complete separation on the x-axis.
