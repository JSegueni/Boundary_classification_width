Figure 2: Classification of TAD boundaries. (A) Examples of TAD boundaries with different patterns of insulation. Left: a narrow boundary between TADs. Middle: an intermediate boundary. Right: an extended boundary. Hi-C data is depicted above. Purple arrowheads indicate the position of the boundary and the blue and yellow rectangles indicate the up- and downstream domains. Below, tracks for the Hi-C insulation score, CTCF and Rad21 ChIP-seq signal and computationally inferred width of the boundaries (purple boxes; see below) are shown. (B) Relative insulation score (IS) in a zoomed-in window of +/- 100 kb from the boundaries shown in panel (a). (C) k -means clustering of TAD boundaries in mouse ESCs, based on the width of IS interval. Left: relative IS (signal; indicative of the width of the boundary). Middle: normalized first derivative of the IS (IS’), indicative of the discreteness of the IS at the boundary. Right: normalized second derivative of the IS (IS”), indicative of the steepness of the boundary. Using k -means clustering of IS”, three categories of insulation score intervals are extracted. Average signal for the three categories in a window of 100 kb up- and downstream of the boundaries is indicated on top and heatmaps for individual boundaries are depicted below. (D) Averaged Hi-C matrices for the three categories of TAD boundaries in a window of 250 kb up- and downstream of the boundaries. (E) Average IS and derivatives for the three categories of TAD boundaries in a zoomed-out window of of +/- 250 kb from the boundaries.
