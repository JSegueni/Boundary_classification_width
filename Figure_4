Figure 4: Average enrichment of chromatin and gene regulatory features around the three categories of TAD boundaries. (A) Average CTCF ChIP-seq signal. (B) Average Rad21 ChIP-seq signal. (C) Average accessible chromatin signal (ATAC-seq). (D) Average ongoing transcription signal (PRO-seq, with signal separated on the plus and minus strand). (E) Average number of TSSs within bins for each TAD boundary category. (F) (left) Fraction of deregulated TSS upon CTCF depletion among all TSS mapping within 100 kb from each TAD boundary category (CTCF-AID cells). (right) Fraction of up- and downregulated TSS upon CTCF depletion among all deregulated TSS within the bins (CTCF-AID cells). The origin of each dataset (mouse ESCs) indicated above the panel. Dashed lines represent the average genome-wide enrichment for each feature. Signal in panels (A-D) is binned to 10 kb and shown in a window of 100 kb up- and downstream of TAD boundaries. Signal in panel (E) is binned to the combined 10 kb up- and downstream of the boundary, and shown in a 100 kb window. Signal in panel (F) is binned to the combined 100 kb up- and downstream of the boundary. The gray bar indicates the genome average. Significance of difference between categories was determined using a G-test of independence.
