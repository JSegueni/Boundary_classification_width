Figure S3: Enrichment of chromatin and gene regulatory features in extended regions around the three clusters of TAD boundaries. (A) Average distribution of CTCF ChIP-seq signal. (B) Average distribution of Rad21 ChIP-seq signal. (C) Average distribution of accessible chromatin signal (ATAC-seq). (D) Average distribution of transcription signal (PRO-seq), with signal separated on the plus and minus strands. (E) Fraction of deregulated Transcriptional Start Sites (TSSs) among all TSSs within bins upon CTCF depletion (RNA-seq in 2-days Auxin-treated CTCF-AID cells). (F) Fraction of up- and downregulated TSSs among deregulated TSSs within bins upon CTCF depletion. The origin of the datasets, all from mouse ESCs, is indicated above each panel. Signal is binned to 10 kb, with dashed lines representing the average genome-wide enrichment. Signal in panels (A-D) is shown in a window of 250 kb up- and downstream of TAD boundaries. Signal in panels (E,F) is merged on both sides of the TAD boundaries and shown in a window up to 100 kb away from the boundaries. Significance of difference between categories for the same bin [panel (E,F)] and for the 0 kb bin versus the combined 10-100 kb bins within the same category [panel (F)] were determined using a G-test of independence.
