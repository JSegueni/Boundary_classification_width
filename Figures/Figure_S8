Figure S8: Overlap of TAD boundaries with A/B compartments and distance from neighboring boundaries. (A) The location of TAD boundaries was scored relative to the position of Hi-C A/B compartments. The orange category represents TAD boundaries that overlap a transition between the A and B compartment. Significance of difference between the three categories was determined using a G-test of independence. Narrow boundaries are relatively enriched at the transition between A/B compartments, although the small size of this category means the number remains limited. Extended boundaries are relatively more enriched within the B-compartment. (B) Distribution of distances from neighboring boundaries for the different boundary categories. For all boundaries, both the distance to the nearest up- and downstream boundary was included.
